A Multi-orbit Millimeter-wave ISAR imaging data set.The dataset is divided into two parts: simulation dataset and measured dataset. The simulation dataset has 20 sets of data, including five orbit models and four target models; the measured dataset is collected by a millimeter-wave radar system with a starting frequency of 77 GHz, and consists of echo data of three satellite physical mod-els.
